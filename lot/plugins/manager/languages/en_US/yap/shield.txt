<p>Make sure the shield package you want to upload is structured like this:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">shield.zip
└── shield/
    ├── file-1.txt
    ├── file-2.txt
    ├── file-3.txt
    ├── file-4.txt
    └── …</code></pre>
<p>You need to add a root folder as a wrapper for all of your shield files, and then you have to give a name for the <code>ZIP</code> file with the same name as the root folder name.</p>
<p>After that, you can activate the shield through the <a href="{{url.manager:config}}" title="Configurations">configuration manager</a> or by pressing the <strong>Attach</strong> button.</p>
