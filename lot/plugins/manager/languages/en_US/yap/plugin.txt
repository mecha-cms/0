<p>﻿Make sure the plugin package you want to upload is structured like this:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">plugin.zip
└── plugin/
    ├── file-1.txt
    ├── file-2.txt
    ├── file-3.txt
    ├── file-4.txt
    └── …</code></pre>
<p>You need to add a root folder as a wrapper for all of your plugin files, and then you have to give a name for the <code>ZIP</code> file with the same name as the root folder name.</p>
